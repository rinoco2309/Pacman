# Pacman Project
## This project uses JavaScript to dynamically add more Pacman's to the screen with the click of a button. Each pacman will move at a different velocity as well
# How to Run
## To run this code, you'll have clone this git and once you have that done, you'll be able to run the hmtl document that requires you to hit start game...you will be able to hit the button to add more pacmans
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
## I'd like to remove the start game button and have it all run off the "add pacman." I would also like to add ghosts to it and implement collision detection to delete pacmans that touch the ghost
